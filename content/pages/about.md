I'm Jithesh Chandrasekharan, a Software Engineer with a passion for breaking down complex concepts into simple, foundational steps. I enjoy exploring technologies from the ground up, focusing on a solid understanding before building upon them. This blog reflects that approach, offering a methodical and thoughtful exploration of the tools and techniques I work with.
This is my personal programming journal, where I share my experiments, experiences, and insights—whether they’re from work or personal projects.
