## What Are Rational Numbers?


A **rational number** is any number that can be expressed in the form of a fraction $( \frac{m}{n} )$, where $( m )$ and ( n ) are integers and $( n \neq 0 )$. Examples include:

- $( \frac{1}{2} )$
- $( -\frac{3}{4} )$
- 5 (which can be written as $( \frac{5}{1} ))$

In rational numbers, both positive and negative fractions exist. If $( n )$ is negative, the rational number is negative.

### **Textual Diagram: Rational Number Representation**

```
Positive Rational Numbers: 1/2, 3/4, 5/6
Negative Rational Numbers: -1/2, -3/4, -5/6
Integers as Rational Numbers: 5 = 5/1, -3 = -3/1
```

## Representation on the Number Line

Rational numbers can be represented on a number line. For instance:

- $( \frac{1}{2} )$ lies halfway between 0 and 1.
- $( -\frac{3}{4} )$ lies three-quarters of the way from 0 to -1.

### **Example:**

```
0  ------ 1/2 -------1
```
```
-1 ------- -3/4 -----0
```

## Equivalent Fractions and Cross-Multiplying

Two rational numbers $( \frac{m}{n} ) and ( \frac{r}{s} )$ are considered equivalent if:

$m \times s = n \times r$

This is known as cross-multiplying.

### **Example:**
- $( \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6} ) because ( 2 \times 6 = 3 \times 4 = 12 )$.

**Textual Diagram:**

```
Cross-multiplying Example: 

  2 x 6 = 3 x 4
  12 = 12 (True, so they are equivalent)
```

## Addition and Subtraction of Rational Numbers

### **Addition with Common Denominators:**

If two rational numbers share a common denominator, you simply add the numerators.


$\frac{a}{n} + \frac{b}{n} = \frac{a + b}{n}$


**Example:** 

$\frac{3}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3 + 2}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1$


### **Addition with Different Denominators:**

When denominators differ, you need to find a common denominator:


$\frac{m}{n} + \frac{r}{s} = \frac{ms + nr}{ns}$


**Example:**


$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 3 + 1 \times 2}{2 \times 3} = \frac{3 + 2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$


### **Subtraction:**

The process is similar to addition, except you subtract the numerators:


$\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$

**Textual Diagram for Addition and Subtraction:**

```
3/4   -   1/4
 |----|----|----|
 0    1/4  2/4  3/4 1

Result: 2/4 = 1/2
```

## Multiplication and Division of Rational Numbers

### **Multiplication:**

To multiply two rational numbers, multiply the numerators and denominators:


$\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}$


**Example:**


$\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{2 \times 3}{3 \times 4} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$


### **Division:**

To divide two rational numbers, multiply by the reciprocal:


$\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c}$


**Example:**


$\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}$


**Textual Diagram for Multiplication:**

```
2/3 x 3/4

(2 x 3)/(3 x 4) = 6/12 = 1/2
```

## Simplifying Rational Numbers

Rational numbers should be presented in their simplest form by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

### **Example:**


$\frac{8}{12} = \frac{8 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{2}{3}$


### **Textual Diagram: Simplification**

```
Original: 8/12
Step 1: Find GCD = 4
Step 2: Divide 8/12 by 4
Result: 2/3
```

## Conclusion

Rational numbers play a critical role in mathematics, providing a way to represent quantities, perform calculations, and understand concepts such as probability and data distributions in AI/ML/Data Science. Mastering these concepts will help you build a strong foundation for more advanced topics.
