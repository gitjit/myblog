Let us first understand the basics of Inheritance in python. A syntax refresher.  Given below is a basic inheritance
syntax in Python.  

```python

class Parent(object):
    def fun(self):
        print('Parent fun!')

class A (Parent):
    def fun(self):
        print('A fun')
        super().fun()


class B(Parent):
    def fun(self):
        print ('B fun')
        super().fun()

```

So here we have a parent class and we are deriving class A and B from the Parent. Then we are using `super()` to 
call the base class method from sub class.  

```python
p = Parent()
a = A()
b = B()

p.fun()
a.fun()
b.fun()

output..
Parent fun!
------------
A fun
Parent fun!
------------
B fun
Parent fun!

```
Now let us consider the scenaio of multiple inheritance as shown below. Here we are deriving C from A and B.

```python
class C(A, B):
    def fun(self):
        print('C fun')
        super().fun()

c = C()
c.fun()

```
outputs..

```bash
C fun
A fun
B fun
Parent fun!

```
So here a question arises why `A.fun()` gets called before than `B.fun()`. This can be answered with a concept called as MRO
(Method Resoulution Order) in Python. Every class holds a magic variable called `__mro__` which stores the inheritance order.
So a method call get resolved based on this order. Let us print the __mro__ for our classes.

`print(C.__mro__)`

outputs..

`(<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.Parent'>, <class 'object'>)`

So it shows that class A get resolved before B and Parent respectively.  So now let us switch the inhertiance order 
as shown below and see the results.

```python
class C(B, A):
    def fun(self):
        print('C fun')
        super().fun()
        
print(C.__mro__)

```
outputs..

`(<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.Parent'>, <class 'object'>)`

Now as expected the resoultion order is reversed with class B before A and parent. 

#### Example : TableFormatter

Now let us write a concrete example to solidify our inheritance understanding. Here we want to create a method `print_table`
which prints tabular data of collection passed to it. In this example we will be making the collection
reading a csv data file as shown below.

<pre class='line-numbers'>
<code class='language-bash'>
# stocks.csv
**Name,Date,Shares,Price**
HPQ,7/11/2007,100,32.2
IBM,7/12/2007,50,91.9
GE,7/13/2007,150,83.44
CAT,7/14/2007,200,51.23
MSFT,7/15/2007,95,40.37
HPE,7/16/2007,50,65.1
AFL,7/17/2007,100,70.44
</code>
</pre>

So as a first step let us create a collection from this data. Let `Holding` be the class corresponding to one row in
the data. 

```python
class Holding(object):
     def __init__(self,name, date, shares, price ):
         self.name = name
         self.date = date
         self.shares = shares
         self.price = price

```

Now let us write a function that can display any objects in a text tabular format.The inputs to this function are
list of objects and column names/attribute names of the objects. We are using `getattr` to get the attribute
value to be displayed. (Its important that column name should match attribute.You can improve this by passing a
tuple which hold display value and attribute value if we need to display diffrent column name than attribute name)

```python
def print_table(objects, columns):
    '''
    This method prints a table from objects using getattr
    :param objects: object list to iterate
    :param columns: column names matching attributes of object
    '''
    # print header
    for col in columns:
        print('{:>10s}'.format(col), end=' ')
    print()
    for obj in objects:
        for col in columns:
            print('{:>10s}'.
                  format(str(getattr(obj, col))), end=' ')
        print()

```

Now let us use the above method to generate table of 'stocks.csv'  First let us load that data into a 
list and then generate the table as shown below.

```python

# program.py
import csv
def load_portfolio():
    holdings = []
    with open('stocks.csv', 'r') as f:
        rows = csv.reader(f)
        head = next(rows)
        for row_no, row in enumerate(rows):

            try:
                holdings.append(Holding(name=row[0], date=row[1],
                                    shares=int(row[2]), price=float(row[3])))

            except ValueError as ve:
                print('Ignoring row {}-{}'.format(row_no,row))

    return holdings
# print the table
print_table(load_portfolio(), ['name','date', 'shares', 'price'] ):

```  

Now comes interesting part, what if we want to print as CSV, html tables etc.. So its good to define
a contract for the formatter and derive sub classess from it, the logic of formatting can be 
eliminated from the print_table().

<img src='2017-04-25-17-36-00.png' class='img-responsive'>

So we can rewrite print_table() as follows.  As first step let us create a base class '`Formatter`',
which is like an interface that specifies the contract.  

```python
class Formatter(object):
    def print_header(self, cols):
        pass

    def print_records(self, objects):
        pass

```

Now let us modify our print_table() as follows.  

```python
def print_table(objects,columns, formatter):
    # print header
    formatter.print_header(columns)

    # print rows
    for obj in objects:
        formatter.print_records([str(getattr(obj, col)) 
                                 for col in columns])

```

Now let us implement our custom formatters. 

TextFormatter..

```python
class TextFormatter(Formatter):

    def print_header(self, headers):
        for head in headers:
            print('{:>10s}'.format(head), end=" ")
        print()

    def print_records(self, rowdata):
        for item in rowdata:
            print('{:>10s}'.format(item), end=" ")
        print()

``` 

CSVFormatter..

```python
class CSVFormatter(Formatter):
    def print_header(self, headers):
        print(','.join(headers))
        print()

    def print_records(self, rowdata):
        print(','.join(rowdata))
        print()

```

HTMLFormatter..

```python
class HTMLFormatter(Formatter):

    def print_header(self, headers):

        print('<tr>')
        for head in headers:
            print('<th>{}</th>'.format(head))
        print('</tr>')

    def print_records(self,rowdata):
        print('<tr>')
        for item in rowdata:
            print('<td>{}</td>'.format(item))
        print('</tr>')

```

Now we can use these formatters as shown below..

```
print_table(load_portfolio(), 
            ['name','date', 'shares', 'price'], 
            HTMLFormatter())

print_table(load_portfolio(), 
            ['name','date', 'shares', 'price'], 
            CSVFormatter())

print_table(load_portfolio(), 
            ['name','date', 'shares', 'price'], 
            TextFormatter())

```

output :

```
#html
<tr>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>date</th>
    <th>shares</th>
    <th>price</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>HPQ</td>
    <td>7/11/2007</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>32.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>IBM</td>
    <td>7/12/2007</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>91.9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
....
....

```
#### Multiple Inheritance  

Python supports multiple inheritance.  So let us consider that in our scenario above. Let us say that I have to print
content in quotes. So let us implement a class that does that.

```python
class QuoteFormatter(object):
    def print_records(self, rowdata):
        quoted = ['"{}"'.format(item) for item in rowdata]
        super().print_records(quoted)
```

Now let us derive a new class from this and our existing class.

```python
class QuoteTextFormatter(QuoteFormatter, TextFormatter):
    pass
```
Now let us call this ..

```python
print_table(load_portfolio(),
            ['name','date', 'shares', 'price'],
            QuoteTextFormatter())

```

output:
```
      name       date     shares      price 
     "HPQ" "7/11/2007"      "100"     "32.2" 
     "IBM" "7/12/2007"       "50"     "91.9" 
      "GE" "7/13/2007"      "150"    "83.44" 
     "CAT" "7/14/2007"      "200"    "51.23" 
    "MSFT" "7/15/2007"       "95"    "40.37" 
     "HPE" "7/16/2007"       "50"     "65.1" 
     "AFL" "7/17/2007"      "100"    "70.44" 

```
In multiple inheritance we know that both parent classes have an implementation of `print_records`, which version of that
will inject into derived class. The answer for that depends on the order of base class. In our case its QuoteFormatter. If you
put the other way, then you won't see any quotes in output.  

### Abstract Class

In our implementation above there is a big flaw, our base class is not implementing the two main methods as shown below.

```python
class Formatter(object):
    def __init__(self, outfile=sys.stdout):
        self.outfile = outfile

    
    def print_header(self, cols):
        pass
    
    def print_records(self, objects):
        pass
```  
So if a developer tries to instantiate this class and pass as parameter to our `print_table` it will break. So in this case
we have to make this class an abstract class. This will ensure that all derived class have implementation of its methods as
well as avoid instantiation of this class object. We can make abstract as follows. 

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Formatter(ABC):
    def __init__(self, outfile=sys.stdout):
        self.outfile = outfile

    @abstractmethod
    def print_header(self, cols):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def print_records(self, objects):
        pass

```

Now if we try following code, it won't compile..
`formatter = Formatter();`
`TypeError`: Can't instantiate abstract class Formatter with abstract methods print_header, print_records

Another way of writing defensive coding is to ensure we are getting expected type instance using `isinstance`()

```python
def print_table(objects,columns, formatter):

    if not isinstance(formatter, Formatter) :
        print('Formatter instance is expected !')
        return
    # print header
    formatter.print_header(columns)

    # print rows
    for obj in objects:
        formatter.print_records([str(getattr(obj, col))
                                 for col in columns])

```

_Coding is fun enjoy..._
